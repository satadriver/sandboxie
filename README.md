Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems. It creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying local & mapped drives or the windows registry. An isolated virtual environment allows controlled testing of untrusted programs and web surfing.<br><br>

## Features
Sandboxie is available in two flavors, Plus and Classic. They both share the same core components, this means they have the same level of security and compatibility.
What's different is the availability of features in the user interface.

Plus build has a modern Qt based UI, which supports all new features that have been added since the project went open source:

  * Snapshot Manager - this feature takes a copy of any box in order to be restored when needed
  * Maintenance mode - it allows to uninstall/install/start/stop Sandboxie driver and service when needed
  * Portable mode - you can run the installer and choose to extract all files to a directory
  * Additional UI options to block access for Windows components like printer spooler and clipboard
  * More customization options for Start/Run and Internet access restrictions
  * Global hotkey to terminate all boxed processes
  * A new firewall per sandbox which supports Windows Filtering Platform (WFP)

Classic build has the old no longer developed MFC based UI, hence it lacks native interface support for Plus features. However, most of them can be configured manually in the Sandboxie.ini configuration file, and some valuable [contributions](https://sandboxie-website-archive.github.io/www.sandboxie.com/old-forums/viewforum1a2d1a2d.html?f=22) can still be applied nowadays.

If you need to check all new features at once, a good way to highlight them quickly is to find the equal sign in the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file.
