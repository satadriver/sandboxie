## [1.0.4 / 5.55.4] - 2021-12-20

### Added
- Mechanism to hook Win32 system calls now also works for 32 bit applications running under WoW64
- Added customization to Win32k hooking mechanism, as by default only GdiDdDDI* hooks are installed
-- You can force the installation of other hooks by specifying them with "EnableWin32Hook=..." 
-- or disable the installation of the default hooks with "DisableWin32Hook=..."
-- Please note that some Win32k hooks may cause BSODs or undefined behaviour. (!)
-- The most obviously problematic Win32k hooks are blacklisted, this can be bypassed with "IgnoreWin32HookBlacklist=y"
- added debug option "AdjustBoxedSystem=n" to disable the adjustment of service ACLs running with a system token
- added "NoUACProxy=y" option together with the accompanying template, in order to disable UAC proxy
-- Note: Boxes configured in compartment mode activate this template by default
- added UI option to change default RpcMgmtSetComTimeout preset
- added Plus installer option to start the default browser under Sandboxie through a desktop shortcut
- added more entries to the Plus installer (current translations on [Languages.iss](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/blob/master/Installer/Languages.iss) file need to be updated)

### Changed
- "EnableWin32kHooks=y" is now enabled by default, as no issues were reported in 1.0.3
-- Note: currently only the GdiDdDDI* hooks are applied, required for Chromium HW acceleration
- Cleaned up low level hooking code a bit
- "RunRpcssAsSystem=y" is now auto applied for boxes in "App Compartment" mode when "RunServicesAsSystem=y" or "MsiInstallerExemptions=y" are present

## [1.0.3 / 5.55.3] - 2021-12-12

### Added
- added mechanism to hook Win32k system calls on Windows 10 and later, this should resolve the issue with Chromium HW acceleration
-- Note: this mechanism does not, yet, work for 32 bit applications running under WoW64
-- to enable it, add "EnableWin32kHooks=y" to the global ini section, this feature is highly experimental (!)
-- the hooks will be automatically applied to Chromium GPU processes
-- to force Win32k hooks for all processes in a selected box, add "AlwaysUseWin32kHooks=program.exe,y" [#1261](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/1261) [#1395](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/1395)

## [1.0.0 / 5.55.0] - 2021-11-17

### Added 
- added Privacy enhanced mode, sandboxes with "UsePrivacyMode=y" will not allow read access to locations containing user data
-- all locations except generic Windows system paths will need to be opened explicitly for read and/or write access
-- using "NormalFilePath=...", "NormalKeyPath=...", "NormalIpcPath=..." allows to open locations to be readable and sandboxed

- added new "App Compartment" mode of operation, it is enabled by adding "NoSecurityIsolation=y" to the box configuration
-- in this mode, security is traded in for compatibility, it should not be used for untrusted applications
-- Note: in this mode, file and registry filtering are still in place, hence processes run without administrative privileges
-- it is reasonably safe, all filtering can be disabled with "NoSecurityFiltering=y"

- added experimental use of ObRegisterCallbacks to filter object creation and duplication 
-- this filtering is independent from the regular SbieDrv's syscall-based filtering, hence it also applies to App Compartments
-- with it enabled, an application running in a compartment will not be able to manipulate processes running outside the sandbox
-- Note: this feature improves the security of non-isolated App Compartment boxes
-- to enable this feature, set "EnableObjectFiltering=y" in the global section and reload the driver
-- when globally activated, the filtering can be disabled for individual boxes with "DisableObjectFilter=y"

- added "DontOpenForBoxed=n", this option disables the discrimination of boxed processes for open file and open key directives
-- this behaviour does not really improve security anyway, but may be annoying, also app compartments always disable this

- added setting to entirely open access to the COM infrastructure

### Changed
- reworked the resource access path matching mechanism to optionally apply more specific rules over less specific ones
-- for example "OpenFilePath=C:\User\Me\AppData\Firefox takes precedence over "WriteFilePath=C:\User\Me\"
-- to enable this new behaviour, add "UseRuleSpecificity=y" to your Sandboxie.ini, this behaviour is always enabled in Privacy enhanced mode
-- added "NormalFilePath=..." to restore default Sandboxie behaviour on a given path
-- added "OpenConfPath=...", which similarly to "OpenPipePath=..." is a "OpenKeyPath=..." variant which applies to executables located in the sandbox
- removed option to copy a box during creation, instead the box context menu offers a duplication option
- reworked the box creation dialog to offer new box types

### Fixed
- fixed SBIE1401 notification during Sandboxie Plus uninstall (by mpheath) [68fa37d](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/commit/68fa37d45be2be3565917d0de097709b7aa009e0)
- fixed memory leak in driver handling FLT_FILE_NAME_INFORMATION (by Therzok) [#1371](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/pull/1371)

- added template for Windows 10 virtual desktop manager [#1326](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/discussions/1326)

### Changed
- "OpenClsid=..." is no longer restricted to CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER execution contexts only
-- this allows to run objects with the CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER flag in the COM helper service
- in the trace view, now multiple types can be selected at once
- a few Plus UI entries were made translatable (by gexgd0419) [#1320](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/pull/1320)
- changed default "terminate all boxed processes" key to Shift+Pause (by isaak654) [#1337](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/1337)

## [0.9.0 / 5.51.0] - 2021-07-29 (pre-release)

### Added
- added support for Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) to be used instead of the device-based network blocking scheme
-- to enable this support, add 'NetworkEnableWFP=y' to the global section and reboot or reload the driver
-- to use WFP for a specific sandbox, add 'AllowNetworkAccess=n'
-- you can allow certain processes by using 'AllowNetworkAccess=program.exe,y'
-- you can also enable this policy globally by adding 'AllowNetworkAccess=n' to the global section
-- in this case you can exempt entire sandboxes by adding 'AllowNetworkAccess=y' to specific boxes
 -- you can block certain processes by using 'AllowNetworkAccess=program.exe,n'
 -- Note: WFP is less absolute than the old approach, using WFP will filter only TCP/UDP communication
--	restricted boxed processes will still be able to resolve domain names using the system service
--  however, they will not be able to send or receive data packets directly
-- the advantages of WFP is that filter rules can be implemented by restricting communication only to specified addresses or selected ports using "NetworkAccess=..."
- added fully functional rule-based packet filter in user mode for the case when "NetworkEnableWFP=y" is not set
-- the mechanism replaces the old "BlockPort=..." functionality
-- Note: this filter applies only to outgoing connections/traffic, for incoming traffic either the WFP mode or a third-party firewall is needed
-- like the old user mode based mechanism, malicious applications can bypass it by unhooking certain functions
-- hence it's recommended to use the kernel mode WFP-based mechanism when reliable isolation is required
- added new trace option "NetFwTrace=*" to trace the actions of the firewall components
-- please note that the driver only trace logs the kernel debug output, use DbgView.exe to log
- API_QUERY_PROCESS_INFO can now be used to get the impersonation token of a sandboxed thread
-- Note: this capability is used by TaskExplorer to allow inspecting sandbox-internal tokens
-- Note: a process must have administrative privileges to be able to use this API
- added a UI option to switch "MsiInstallerExemptions=y" on and off
-- just in case a future Windows build breaks something in the systemless mode
- added sample code for ObRegisterCallbacks to the driver
- added new debug options "DisableFileFilter=y" and "DisableKeyFilter=y" that allow to disable file and registry filtering
-- Note: these options are for testing only and disable core parts of the sandbox isolation
- added a few command line options to SandMan.exe

### Changed
- greatly improved the performance of the trace log, but it's no longer possible to log to both SandMan and SbieCtrl at the same time
- reworked process creation code to use PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx and improved process termination

### Fixed
- added missing hook for ConnectEx function

### Fixed
- fixed issue with the "Explore Sandboxed" command [#972](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/972)
- rolled back the switch from using NtQueryKey to NtQueryObject as it seems to break some older Windows 10 versions like 1803 [#984](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/984)

-- Note: this change provides an almost static system call speed of 1.2µs regardless of the running process count
-- The old list, with 100 programs running required 4.5µs; with 200: 12µs; and with 300: 18µs per syscall
-- Note: some of the slowdown was also affecting non-sandboxed applications due to how the driver handles certain callbacks
- replaced the per-process Thread List used by the driver with a much faster Hash Map implementation
- replaced configuration section list with a hash map to improve configuration performance, and increased line limit to 100000
-- not yet enabled in production build
- the presence of the default box is only checked on connect
- the portable directory dialog now shows the directory [#924](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/924)

-- this allowed elevated processes to change passwords, delete users and alike; to disable filtering use "OpenSamEndpoint=y"
- FIXED SECURITY ISSUE: "\Device\DeviceApi\CMApi" is now filtered by the driver (thanks hg421) [#552](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/552)
-- this allowed elevated processes to change hardware configuration; to disable filtering use "OpenDevCMApi=y"

## [0.5.4 / 5.46.0] - 2021-01-06

### Added
- FIXED SECURITY ISSUE: Sandboxie now strips particularly problematic privileges from sandboxed system tokens
-- with those a process could attempt to bypass the sandbox isolation (thanks Diversenok)
-- old legacy behaviour can be enabled with "StripSystemPrivileges=n" (absolutely NOT Recommended) 
- added new isolation options "ClosePrintSpooler=y" and "OpenSmartCard=n" 
-- those resources are open by default, but for a hardened box it is desired to close them

### Changed
- Changed Emulated SCM behaviour, boxed services are no longer by default started as boxed system
-- use "RunServicesAsSystem=y" to enable the old legacy behaviour
-- Note: sandboxed services with a system token are still sandboxed and restricted 
-- However not granting them a system token in the first place removes possible exploit vectors
-- Note: this option is not compatible with "ProtectRpcSs=y" and takes precedence!
